DataSpider is a meta-data crawler that is closely linked to the meta-data data model Kosh https://github.com/modakanalytics/kosh. In fact, in order for DataSpider to execute, there needs to be an instantiated version of Kosh that DataSpider can connect to.  It is also closely related to another opensource project BotWorks https://github.com/modakanalytics/botworks.
